Memoet is a web app that dedicate to help people finding fun again while
learning to memorize things. **Memo** comes from "memory" and **et** is a
suffix to make the name sound more human ;)

In the beginning, we have combined a quiz system (type answer & multiple choice
question for now) with a spaced repetition algorithm (SuperMemo2) and built them
right into notes.

The app is already up and running at memoet.manhtai.com, give it a try when you
had the time.

That was the first step of a long journey. Along the way, we want to share
things we are learning and building to make Memoet better. It will cover
all things from technical stuffs to product development.

We dedicate ourselves to make learning easier, we hope that Memoet would
become the first successful solution.

Stay tuned!
